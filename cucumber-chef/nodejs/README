Your general workflow will be to write cucumber features that describe the intended behaviour of 'nodejs'.  You will then write failing tests by writing steps to test the behaviour, expressing them as cucumer scenarios.

Then run your tests with:

cucumber-chef test nodejs

For an example feature, take a look at ./nodejs/features/example.feature

For an example step definition, look at ./nodejs/features/example.feature
